# finesse_process
This is for the FINESSE instrument at Imperial. It is processing code.

One folder for IDL version

One folder for Python version

One folder for comparing simulations to FINESSE observations (need to upload)

# Within Python processing code:
File 0  is just reading the sensors to track BB temperatures 
File 1  is preparing the interferograms for single or multi (averaged 40)
File 2 is calculating the response functions (always done in multi case)
File 3a is doing calibration for multi case
File 3b is doing calibration for single case [NOTE THIS CODE IS NOT FINISHED]

Quick plot file:
- For checking the final callibration spectra
- Features to add: Time evolution plots
